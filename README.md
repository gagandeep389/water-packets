**WaterContract**

This Solidity smart contract, `WaterContract`, facilitates the management of water stock and transactions. It allows users to purchase water packs and consume them, with appropriate checks and balances to ensure transparency and fairness.

### Features:

1. **Water Purchase:** Users can purchase water packs by sending ether to the contract. Each pack costs 1 ether. Upon purchase, the corresponding amount of water packs is added to the buyer's stock.

2. **Water Consumption:** The contract owner can consume water packs, deducting them from their stock. There is a restriction that the owner can consume only one pack at a time.

3. **Events:** Events are emitted for each water purchase and consumption, providing transparency and allowing external systems to react to these actions.

### Contract Structure:

- **`owner`:** The address of the contract owner who has special privileges.
- **`waterStock`:** A mapping to track the amount of water packs owned by each address.
- **`WaterPurchased` Event:** Emits when water is purchased, indicating the buyer's address and the amount purchased.
- **`WaterConsumed` Event:** Emits when water is consumed by the owner, indicating the owner's address and the amount consumed.

### Modifiers:

- **`onlyOwner`:** Restricts certain functions to be called only by the contract owner.
- **`sufficientStock`:** Checks if the caller has sufficient water stock for the specified amount.

### Usage:

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.
2. Users can call the `purchaseWater` function to buy water packs by sending ether.
3. The contract owner can consume water packs using the `consumeWater` function.

### Considerations:

- Ensure that the contract is deployed securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- Set appropriate gas limits and consider gas costs for transactions.
- Test the contract thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment.
